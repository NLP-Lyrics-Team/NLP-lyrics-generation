## NLP lyrics generation
Neural networks and language models allow us to train a machine learning model that is able not only to classify a given text, but also to generate one. The task of this project is the following: find a dataset of songs lyrics, possibly with info about the genre, and develop a model able to generate lyrics for a song of any of the genres considered.
